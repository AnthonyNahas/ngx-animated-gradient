https://AnthonyNahas.github.io/ngx-animated-gradient\nDependencies\n\nAngular (requires Angular 2 or higher, tested with 2.0.0)\n\nInstallation\n1. Install via ng add. (Recommended)\nNow add the library via the angular schematics\nshell\nng add ngx-animated-gradient\n2. Install via npm. (Alternative)\nNow install ngx-animated-gradient via:\nshell\nnpm install --save ngx-animated-gradient\n\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for ngx-animated-gradient:\n```js\nmap: {\n  'ngx-animated-gradient': 'node_modules/ngx-animated-gradient/bundles/ngx-animated-gradient.umd.js',\n}\n\n```\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\njs\nimport { NgxAnimatedGradientModule } from 'ngx-animated-gradient';\nThe only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice NgxAnimatedGradientModule .forRoot()):\n```js\nimport { NgxAnimatedGradientModule } from 'ngx-animated-gradient';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgxAnimatedGradientModule.forRoot(), ...],  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nOther modules in your application can simply import NgxAnimatedGradientModule:\n```js\nimport { NgxAnimatedGradientModule } from 'ngx-animated-gradient';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgxAnimatedGradientModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n```\nUsage\n```html\n\n```\n\nanother full example \n```html\n\n      \n        ngx-animated-gradient\n      \n      \n      \n    \n```\n\n| option | bind  |  type  |   default    | description  |\n|:-------------------|:--------:|:------:|:------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|| colors       | Input()  | RGBValue    | (see the code ;)) |  colors to render\n| tickSpeed   | Input()  | number| 16 |  The tick speed for calling the update of the gradient\n| colorIndices   | Input()  | number[] | [0, 1, 2, 3] | The color indices, these indicate where in the color table to load from\n| gradientSpeed   | Input()  | number | 0.002 | The multiplier for the gradient speed\nContributors\n\n@tanepiper  \n\nCredit\nThis library is an angular directive/version of this codepen\n\n\n\nOther Angular Libraries\n\nngx-auth-firebaseui\n@firebaseui/ng-bootstrap\nngx-linkifyjs\n@angular-material-extensions/password-strength\n@angular-material-extensions/link-preview\n@angular-material-extensions/pages\n@angular-material-extensions/contacts\n@angular-material-extensions/faq\n@angular-material-extensions/jumbotron\n@angular-material-extensions/google-maps-autocomplete\n@angular-material-extensions/combination-generator\n\n\n\nSupport\n\nDrop an email to: Anthony Nahas\n\nor open an appropriate issue\n\nlet us chat on Gitter\nBuilt by and for developers :heart: we will help you :punch:\n\n\n\n\nThis project is supported by jetbrains with 1 ALL PRODUCTS PACK OS LICENSE incl. webstorm\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2019 Anthony Nahas.
